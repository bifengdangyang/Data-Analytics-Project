Knowledge Discovery for Crimes Against Children(Group Project) 

This group project seeks to discover knowledge about crimes against children through data mining of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime data source.  The main goal is to identify the characteristics of victims, offenders, and the situational threats in which children are especially vulnerable to categories of offenses. 
 My role in the team is to 
•	balance the unbalanced dataset
•	 visualize dataset’s multiple  perspectives using SHAP chart, simple dependence plot, Lime chart( Local interpretable model agnostic explanations) 
•	build several  machine learning models( penalized logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, Gradient Boosting)  to get insight from dataset.  I used Python and R for my work. 
Python API:  Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Xgboost, matplotlib.
R  API:  dplyr,tidyr,DMwR,ggplot2,iml,data.table
