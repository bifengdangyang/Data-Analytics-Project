
Data issues:

1 

in Stacked Roseter.csv ,  years of service <0 , those data are wrong, looking future ,we see it is caused by start date which can not be late  than Snapshot Date 

It is not related to other task I need to do ,so I did not process it . 
for this case ,if related task , we can either remove those wrong entries or double check with provider asking for correct data ; 
if can not obtain correct data from provider, we may use other datas to do regression or machine learning technicals   to fix the wrong data 

2  

Employee education.csv 

many missing values , we can observe the data and make reasonable assumption
such as if it has degree year , then the employee received the degree even degree received column is empty
